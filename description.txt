UIHandle
	ctor() save credentials from JSON into ui_hashtab
	
SerialCom
	ctor() starts connection_loop thread 
	
	connection_loop	=> tries to open port {creates handle) every 5 seconds.
		if port is down, handle is to be closed}
			=> starts thread event_callback when handle{port} is up {set communication mask and drop in while(1))
			
    event_callback => communication events recognition; e.g. calls read_port() if new data arrived

1. Application starts
2. 						

Application contains 4 handles that operates in Overlapped mode.

HANDLE = opaque value that acts as a reference to a system resource, such as a file, 
device, memory object, synchronization object, or process

Overlapped means asynchronous what guarantee non blocking behaviour throughout
(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sync/synchronization-and-overlapped-input-and-output)
The WriteFile, ReadFile, DeviceIoControl, WaitCommEvent, ConnectNamedPipe, 
and TransactNamedPipe functions can be performed either synchronously or asynchronously.

Main handle {port} refers to connected bletooth device,
they are also oWrite,oRead and oEvent 


 Example Read operation:
	1.create read HANDLE
	2.ReadFile with read HANDLE, {port} device HANDLE and buffer for data
	3. WaitForSingleObject with read HANDLE and time waiting for data (500ms)
	4. calls GetOverlappedResult() HANDLE has been signaled in 3
	5. returns number of bytes
	6. withdraw_buffer() takes amount of bytes and starts new thread with process_data()

Process make use of x threads:
- handle_t
- event_t
- callback_t
